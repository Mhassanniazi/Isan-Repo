        "Marriage is God’s civilizational sunnah and from the great gifts given to humankind and an obligation for able Muslims. Amongst the great challenges that our Muslim community is facing in America is the facilitation of marriage and in particular healthy marriages. Ihsan coaching’s earnest and contextualized approach towards marital coaching is critical in our time given the predicament we find ourselves in. Ihsans multi dimensional approach includes modern tools and resources, but most importantly is rooten in Islamic values and presented a spiritual dimension towards marital coaching, something missing in our time. We ask Allah to open doors for Farhan and his team, and benefit the ummah by them.",

        "In a time where members of our communities are increasingly facing mental health issues, marital disputes etc, it is imperative to have services which cater to their needs. Alhamdulillah, it is a breath of fresh air that Br. Farhan and his team at Ihsan Coaching have been doing just that. They have stepped up to provide a needed platform for Muslims facing these realistic issues. Their coaches provide a balance of both the Islamic as well as secular perspectives when dealing with their clients. Alhamdulillah, our community has also established a partnership with Ihsan Coaching, so that our members also benefit from their services. I hope many others realize that there is someone to talk to when needing help. Please do not be silent and reach out to them! I highly recommend their organization. May Allah continue to grant them success and the ability to help others.",
